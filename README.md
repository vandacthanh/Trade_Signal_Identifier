# Trade_Signal_Identifier
This Python script uses the Streamlit library to create a web application for analyzing financial market data. Here's a breakdown of what the code does and some documentation for its main components:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - The code begins by importing necessary Python libraries, including `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `talib`, `tvDatafeed`, `plotly`, `datetime`, `statsmodels`, and `sklearn`. These libraries are used for data analysis, visualization, and building the web application.

2. **Data Retrieval Function (`data_retrieval`)**:
   - This function retrieves historical market data for a specified asset from various financial markets using the `TvDatafeed` library.
   - It also calculates technical indicators such as KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average) and Ichimoku Cloud for the asset's price data.
   - The retrieved data is cleaned by dropping rows with missing values and reformatting the timestamp.

3. **Plotting Function (`plot_dataframe`)**:
   - This function uses Plotly to create a time series chart that displays the closing price of the asset, KAMA, and various Ichimoku Cloud components.
   - The function returns the Plotly chart for display in the Streamlit app.

4. **Signal Detection Function (`signal_detector`)**:
   - This function analyzes the current state of the market by comparing the closing price of the asset with KAMA and Ichimoku Cloud components.
   - Depending on the conditions met, it displays messages indicating whether a bullish, bearish, or consolidation pattern is detected.

5. **Time Series Prediction Function (`time_series_prediction`)**:
   - This function prepares historical data for time series forecasting using VAR (Vector AutoRegressive) modeling.
   - It splits the data into training and validation sets, fits a VAR model to the training data, and calculates RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each feature.
   - The function then forecasts future data points and returns the predictions in a DataFrame.

6. **Main Application Code (`if __name__ == "__main__":)**:
   - The main part of the script is enclosed within this conditional block, which runs when the script is executed.
   - It defines the Streamlit sidebar with input parameters for selecting the market, asset, interval, and other options.
   - It retrieves and plots the historical market data, detects trading signals, and displays time series predictions based on user selections.

**Usage**:
- To use this application, you would run the script, and a Streamlit web app would be launched in your browser.
- You can select the market, asset, interval, and other parameters from the sidebar to analyze and visualize financial market data.
- The application provides information about trading signals, technical indicators, and time series predictions.

**Note**:
- Some parts of the code use external libraries and functions (e.g., `ichimoku` and `TvDatafeed`) that are not provided in the code snippet. Ensure you have these libraries and dependencies installed to run the code successfully.
- The code mentions the author "Van Dac Thanh," so it's possible that the original code or additional documentation may be available from the author or in the project's original repository.
